## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email` or `Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the contact page map. The addresses we have on the design are fictional, so you'll need to add real addresses for this bonus task.

### What I learned

While it may not have felt like it during debugging, this project was by far my favorite to complete. I learned how to implement image filters, gradients and had more experience positioning elements absolutely than ever before. As a result, this project took a long time to design and implement from scratch. While I am pleased that the final product shares an almost pixel perfect resemblance to what the artist envisioned, I must admit that my approach to styling elements has not been optimized and can be done with a drastic improvement in efficiency. More time spent in the planning phase will pay dividends in the implementation of the CSS classes. This critique aside, I was pleased by the results of the logic for the contact page, especially implementing the map and form validation features.

### Continued development

Working on this project exposed me to quite the range of new tools and features, but it also exposed a glaring weakness in my styling. My approach of styling section by individual section is both time consuming and needlessly repetetive. Taking more time to distill overarching themes in the element structure of a website can allow for the creation of modular classes than can be applied to many elements which can then be tweaked as required to acheive a more tailored design. Also, I am well aware of my tendency to fight the browser by defining dimensions as well as margin and padding. For my next project I intend to flow like water.
